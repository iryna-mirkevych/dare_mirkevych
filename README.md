# Task 1 Software configuration
## Subtask 1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio? 

I would like to learn automation QA instruments to *__have more flexibility__* in testing. I dreamed of it when I finished a manual testing course some time ago. 

*__My goal__* is to become a trainee and to work in QA. I expect this project to help me grow and gain new skills.

Besides, I am happy to learn from professionals and to have ability to work as a team with other participants. 

May the force be with us,

Iryna
